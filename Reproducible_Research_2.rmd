## Data Processing
Loading data: readr's read_csv is used to load the data, as it is an order of magnitude faster than the base read.csv. Unfortunately, the data file crashes data.table 1.9.6's fread function.

Summarizing data: For each Event Type, sum the fatalities, injuries, property damage, and crop damage.
```{r load_data}
library(data.table)
library(readr)
dataset <- data.table(read_csv('../repdata-data-StormData.csv.bz2'))

# Convert all EventTypes to upper case before summarizing them, as an initial method of reducing data variation in EventTypes.
dataset[,EVTYPE := toupper(EVTYPE)]

SummaryStatistics <- dataset[, lapply(.SD, sum, na.rm=TRUE), by=EVTYPE, 
                     .SDcols=c('FATALITIES', 'INJURIES', 'PROPDMG', 'CROPDMG')]
```
