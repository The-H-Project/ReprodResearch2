This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Data Processing
readr's read_csv is used to load the data, as it is an order of magnitude faster than the base read.csv. Unfortunately, the data file crashes data.table's fread function.
```{r load_data}
library(data.table)
library(readr)
dataset <- data.table(read_csv('../repdata-data-StormData.csv'))

```
